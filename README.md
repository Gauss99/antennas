A repository for my final project where I simulated a range of microstrip patch antennas patterns and generated different .csv files for exploratory data analysis and machine learning.

This repo contains 5 .csv generated through ANSYS 2022 where I simulated microstrip patch antennas varying different parameters, such as length, subsctract height, so on and so forth. The values for the dieletric constants used where from existing materials, being [2.2, 3.0, 4.4, 6.15, 10.2]. The L dimension range differently for each epsilon value in order to preserve the stipulated range of frequency. Through these datasets, a exploratory data analysis and data cleaning was made, filling discrepant values and generating subdatasets for each L. After it, a final dataset consisting of only resonant frequencies of the primary mode was created, wich will be used for a Machine Learning algorithm so it can predict a resonant frequency/physical dimension of any point in between the 1 GHz and 10 GHz range and epsilon values used.
